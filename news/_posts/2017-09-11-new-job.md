I successfully defended my PhD thesis on September 7th, 2017. I'm thankful to my PhD advisor [Shaun Mahony](http://mahonylab.org/) for being a wonderful mentor and guiding me through my graduate studies. I will be starting as a computational biologist at [Fulcrum Therapeutics](http://www.fulcrumtx.com/).
