I'm a final year Ph.D student working with [Shaun Mahony](http://mahonylab.org/) at [Penn State](http://www.psu.edu/). I am a computational biologist with broad research interests in gene regulation and functional genomics. During my Ph.D, I [studied](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590916304027) how a cocktail of 3 transcription factors (TFs) convert embryonic stem cells into spinal motor neurons. Working on this system led me to thinking about general aspects of TF binding determinants and also motivated me to develope a [computational tool](https://github.com/seqcode/sequnwinder) to discover sequence features asocciated with serveral defined categories of regulatory sites.

Going forward, I'm excited to leverage my unique computational biology experiecne to make contributions to single cell genomics, personalized medicine and other areas of genomics.

Before joining Penn State, I spent two years at the [Virginia Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.bi.vt.edu/) studying global genomic responses to environmental stress in plants. Going further back, I spent four amazing years at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ac.in/) studying biochemical engineering.
