I created this website to help potential recruiters to easily navigate and learn about my projects and things I'm passionate about. This website piggybacks on a lot of open source code and efforts from the [Bedford](http://bedford.io/team/trevor-bedford/) and [Drummond](http://drummondlab.org/) labs. I greatly appreciate their generosity in making their website's underlying code publically available. In that spirit, the source code for this entire website has been published as a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ikaka89/ikaka89.github.io). This website is also hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I plan to make more stylistic and layout changes in the new near future.
